Subject: Re: Clinical Documentation

I sent information on ticket #5591 3 days ago and haven't heard back.

This is the second time this month I've had to repeat myself. I'm spending more time explaining our problems than getting them fixed.

Our CMO just asked me if we should look at other platforms. I don't know what to tell them.
